1- To run this code make sure you have following files in your working directory
	1.1 basis_expansion.m
	1.2 Cross_Validate.m
	1.3 load_data.m
	1.4 project1.m
	1.5 run_project.m
	1.6 Square_Error.m
	1.7 testinputs.txt
	1.8 traindata.txt
	1.9 Transformation.m

2- run the script run_project.m from you command prompt, if everything is in order you should see output on your screen, a graph for cross validation error, a plot for comparing actual y_train and our predicted y on our best model and a file y_pred.mat created in your working directory.

3. You can also update values of k and degrees_to_check in run_project script. (if you put k = n (926 in our case) you will see results for LOOCV)
