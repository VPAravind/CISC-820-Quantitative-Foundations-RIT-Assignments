1. Make sure you have following files in your working directory 
	1.1: Test_Fuc.m (for Uniform Distribution Exps)
	1.2: Test_Func_Bern.m (for Bernoulli Exps)
	1.3: Test_Func_Norm.m (for Normal Exps)
	1.4: sample_bernoulli.m 
	1.5: sample_noraml.m
	1.6: sample_uniform.m
	1.7 ci.m

2. To run experiments related to each distribution just run that file 
3. It is going to take very long to run all the experiments (we have attached txt files for each experiment)
4. To replicate particular experiment, you will have to change the respective file
5. To alter functions you need to change func_no array
6. to run with particular values, you should find the values array at the beginning of each file
